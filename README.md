**8-Puzzle Solver**
This project implements an 8-puzzle solver using the following algorithms:

    •	Depth-First Search (DFS)
    
    •	Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    
    •	A Search Algorithm*

**Files Overview**

    •	**algorithms.py**: Implements search algorithms.
    
    •	**puzzle.py**: Defines the puzzle mechanics and operations.
    
    •	**solver.py**: Combines components to solve the puzzle. It is also the entry point to run the solver.
    
    •	**utils.py**: Provides helper functions for the project.
    
    •	**todo.todo**: Tracks development notes and tasks.

**Features**

    •	Solve custom 8-puzzle configurations.
    
    •	Compare DFS, BFS, and A* performance.

**How to Run**
    
    •	Ensure all required files are in the same directory.
    
    •	Run the **solver.py** file to test the solver
            Terminal: python solver.py
