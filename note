1. Algorithm Implementation (Backend) 

•	Member 1:
    o	Implement BFS (Breadth-First Search)
    o	Implement DFS (Depth-First Search)
    o	Implement basic puzzle state management (move tiles, check solvability, etc.)
    o	Handle input (initial and goal state) and random puzzle generation
•	Member 2:
    o	Implement A* (with Manhattan or Misplaced Tile heuristic)
    o	Focus on heuristic functions for A* and optimization
•	Joint Task:
    o	Combine the BFS/DFS and A* code into a single solver class
    o	Write a function to compare the performance of BFS, DFS, and A*
    o	Debug and test each other's code

2. Visualization and CLI Output 

•	Member 1:
    o	Design the CLI to print the 8-puzzle at each step of the solution
    o	Write functions to display the puzzle grid and steps in a readable format
    o	Implement step-by-step movement (animation-style printing in the terminal)
•	Member 2:
    o	Handle logic for animating the path from start to goal (printing each move)
    o	Create a solution summary (number of moves, time taken, etc.)
    o	Format the output neatly and add prompts for user interaction
•	Joint Task:
    o	Test and visualize different puzzles
    o	Ensure the output explains how each algorithm progresses
    o	Compare the steps visually between BFS/DFS and A*

3. Testing and Optimization 

•	Member 1:
    o	Test BFS/DFS performance on different puzzle states
    o	Optimize the DFS to avoid loops and improve its efficiency
    o	Ensure BFS finds the shortest path every time
•	Member 2:
    o	Test A* with different heuristics (Manhattan vs. Misplaced Tiles)
    o	Optimize the heuristic functions to improve A* performance
    o	Benchmark A* and compare it with BFS/DFS in terms of speed
•	Joint Task:
    o	Debug errors, test with edge cases (solvable vs. unsolvable puzzles)
    o	Ensure all algorithms are consistent and reliable
    o	Document any improvements or limitations
